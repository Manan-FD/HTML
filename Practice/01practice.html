    <h1>Maharanapratap</h1>
    <p>Maharana Pratap, is a name worth remembering to begin one's day with. His name is engraved with gold among the
        list of valiant kings who
        protected the Nation, Dharma, Culture and Freedom of this country by sacrificing his life ! This is a holy
        remembrance of his valour !

        Who does not know the name of the great king of Mewar, Maharana Pratap Singh? In the history of India, this name
        has always proved to be
        motivating for qualities like valour, bravery, sacrifice and martyrdom. Many brave warriors like Bappa Rawal,
        Rana Hamir, Rana Sang were
        born unto the Sisodiya family of Mewar and were given the title of ‘Rana’ but the title of ‘Maharana’ was only
        bestowed on Pratap Singh.
        During Maharana Pratap Singh’s time, Akbar was the Mughal Ruler in Delhi. His policy was to make use of the
        strength of Hindu kings to bring
        other Hindu Kings under his control. Many Rajput kings, abandoning their glorious traditions and fighting
        spirit, sent their daughters and
        daughters-in-law to the harem of Akbar with the purpose of gaining rewards and honour from Akbar. Uday Singh
        appointed before his death,
        Jagammal, the son of his youngest wife as his heir although Pratap Singh was elder to Jagammal but he was ready
        to give up his rights
        like Prabhu Ramchandra and go away from Mewar but the chieftains did not at all agree with their king’s
        decision. Besides they were of
        the opinion that Jagammal did not possess qualities like courage and self-respect which were essential in a
        leader and king. Hence it
        was collectively decided that Jagammal would have to sacrifice the throne. Maharana Pratap Singh too gave due
        respect to the wish of
        the chieftains and the people and accepted the responsibility of leading the people of Mewar.

    <h2>swamivivekanada</h2>
    <p>Swami Vivekananda (/ˈswɑːmi ˌvɪveɪˈkɑːnəndə/; Bengali: [ʃami bibekanɔndo] (listen); 12 January 1863 – 4 July
        1902), born Narendranath
        Datta (Bengali: [nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]), was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the
        chief disciple of
        the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.[4][5] He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western
        world[6][7][8]
        and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world
        religion.[9]

        Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards
        religion and
        spirituality. He later found his guru, Ramakrishna, and became a monk. After the death of Ramakrishna,
        Vivekananda extensively
        toured the Indian subcontinent, acquiring first-hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then
        British India.
        Moved by their plight, he resolved to help his countrymen and found a way to travel to the United States, where
        he became a
        popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, in which he began his famous speech with the
        words: Sisters
        and brothers of America... before introducing Hinduism to Americans.[10][11] He was so impactful at the
        Parliament that an
        American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the
        Parliament".[12]

        After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures
        across the United States,
        England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New
        York and the Vedanta
        Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern California),[13] both of which became the foundations
        for Vedanta
        Societies in the West. In India, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for
        monastics and
        householder devotees, and the Ramakrishna Mission that provides charity, social work and education.[7]

        Vivekananda was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India, and the
        most successful
        missionaries of Vedanta to the Western world. He was also a major force in contemporary Hindu reform movements,
        and contributed
        to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.[14] He is now widely regarded as one of the most influential
        people of modern
        India and a patriotic saint. His birthday in India is celebrated as National Youth Day.[15][16]</p>
    <h3>mahatmagandhi</h3>
    <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[pron 1] (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer,[4] anti-colonial
        nationalist[5] and political
        ethicist[6] who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from
        British rule.[7] He inspired
        movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: "great-souled",
        "venerable"), first applied to
        him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.[8][9]

        Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and
        was called to the bar at
        age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice,
        he moved to South Africa
        in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was
        here that Gandhi raised a
        family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to
        India and soon set about
        organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.

        Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty,
        expanding women's rights,
        building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule.
        Gandhi adopted the short dhoti
        woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a
        self-sufficient residential community,
        to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing
        anti-colonial nationalism to
        the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi
        Salt March in 1930 and in
        calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South
        Africa and India.</p>
